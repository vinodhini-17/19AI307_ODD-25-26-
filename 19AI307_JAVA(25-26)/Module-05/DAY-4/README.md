## AIM:
To write a Java program to create a thread by extending the Thread class.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program.
2. Create a class that extends the Thread class.
3. Override the run() method.
4. Write the task to be executed inside the run() method.
5. Create an object of the thread class.
6. Call the start() method to start the thread.
7. Display the thread execution message.
8. End the program.
   
## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*

    }
}

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
